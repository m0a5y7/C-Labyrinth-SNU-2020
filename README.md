# C-Labyrinth-SNU-2020

Summary: This repository includes a video game project for the Seoul National University course Theory and Practice in Computational Sciences 2. The game is a simple grid-based GUI application where a user is able to move a circle in a labyrinth with obstacles. This code was intended as the base mapping for a more extensive GUI labyrinth game.
